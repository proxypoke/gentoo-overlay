	<longdescription lang="en">
	shellex is supposed to be a dmenu-style launcher with a lot more features and a
	lot simpler design. It launches a shell (currently zsh) and shows it in a small
	terminal, wrapping every command with a little bit of extra magic (redirecting
	stdout, stderr, disowning and closing the shell) to get more typical
	launcher-behaviour.

	This gives you a simple launcher with tab-completion and other shell-features,
	configurable in shell.
